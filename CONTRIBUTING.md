## How Can I Contribute?

### Contributing Code

A lot of annyang's functionality came from pull requests sent over GitHub.

If you would like to help, please take care to read the following points:

* Make sure to run `npm install` and `grunt` and make sure all tasks completed successfully before committing.
* Do not change the [API docs](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/blob/master/docs/README.md) in `/docs/README.md` directly. This file is generated automatically, and your changes will be overwritten. Instead, update the relevant comments in annyang.js
* annyang is still not automatically tested :disappointed:. If you make a change, please make sure to test your change thoroughly to make sure no backward functionality was broken, and that your change works as intended.
* Do not update the version number yourself.
* Please stick to the project's existing coding style. Coding styles don't need to have a consensus, they just need to be consistent :smile:.
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository. Your branch should be based on the `master` branch.
* When submitting [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/), please elaborate as much as possible about the change, your motivation for the change, etc.

### Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/issues). If you found a bug with annyang, the quickest way to get help would be to look through existing open and closed [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/issues?q=is%3Aissue). If the issue is already being discussed and hasn't been resolved yet, you can join the discussion and provide details about the problem you are having. If this is a new bug, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/issues/new).

When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem.

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem. Share the relevant code to reproduce the issue if possible.
* Try to isolate the issue as much as possible, reducing unrelated code until you get to the minimal amount of code in which the bug still reproduces. This is the most important step to help the community solve the issue.

### Feature Requests and Ideas

We track discussions of new features, proposed changes and other ideas as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/issues). If you would like to discuss one of those, please first look through existing open and closed [GitHub issues](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and see if there is already a discussion on this topic which you can join. If there isn't, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/TalAter/annyang/issues/new).

When discussing new ideas or proposing changes, please take the time to be as descriptive as possible about the topic at hand. Please take the time to explain the issue you are facing, or the problem you propose to solve in as much detail as possible.
